Super simple coffee-shop example of a builder being used with decorators for applying costings and deals using builders and decorators.

- Uses the builder pattern to build up products. 
- Inside the builder pattern we use decorators to apply costs per product option. 

- Uses the builder pattern to build up orders.
- Inside the orders we use the decorator pattern again to apply a buy one get cheapest free.

I made this for funzies don't judge me too harshly.
